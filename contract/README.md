    uint256[] memory amounts,
    string[] memory descriptions
) external returns (uint256)
```
Creates a new group with specified recipients and amounts.

**payForRecipient**
```solidity
function payForRecipient(uint256 groupId, address recipientAddress)

## UI Integration

### Group Page Integration

The Group contract integrates with the UI through these key interactions:

1. **Create Group Form** → `createGroup()` function
   - Group name, description, amount
   - Dynamic recipient addresses
   - Individual amounts per recipient

2. **Group Card Display** → `getGroupDetails()` function
   - Group name, description, total recipients
   - Created date, status

3. **Payment Processing** → `payForRecipient()` function
   - Individual recipient payments
   - Payment status tracking

### Event Page Integration

The Event contract integrates with the UI through these key interactions:

1. **Create Event Form** → `createEvent()` function
   - Event name, description
   - Wallet address for fund collection
   - Active until datetime

2. **Event Card Display** → `getEventDetails()` function
   - Event name, description, end date
   - Created date, balance

3. **Deposit/Withdraw** → `depositToEvent()` / `withdrawFromEvent()` functions
   - Fund deposits from contributors
   - Creator withdrawals

## Security Features

### Both Contracts Include:
- **ReentrancyGuard**: Prevents reentrancy attacks
- **Ownable**: Contract owner controls for emergency functions
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter validation
- **Access Control**: Creator-only functions where appropriate
- **Emergency Functions**: Owner can pause contracts if needed

### Group Contract Specific:
- Payment amount validation
- Recipient existence checks
- Group completion tracking
- Creator-only group deactivation

### Event Contract Specific:
- Time-based activation checks
- Expiration management
- Creator-only withdrawals
- Automatic fund transfers

## Events

### Group Events:
- `GroupCreated`: Emitted when a new group is created
- `RecipientAdded`: Emitted when a recipient is added to a group
- `PaymentReceived`: Emitted when a payment is received
- `GroupCompleted`: Emitted when all payments are complete

### Event Events:
- `EventCreated`: Emitted when a new event is created
- `DepositReceived`: Emitted when a deposit is made
- `WithdrawalMade`: Emitted when funds are withdrawn
- `EventExpired`: Emitted when an event expires

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Group
```javascript
// Frontend call
const groupId = await groupContract.createGroup(
    "Team Lunch",
    "Monthly team lunch payments",
    ["0x123...", "0x456...", "0x789..."],
    [ethers.utils.parseEther("0.1"), ethers.utils.parseEther("0.1"), ethers.utils.parseEther("0.1")],
    ["Payment 1", "Payment 2", "Payment 3"]
);
```

### Paying for a Group
```javascript
// Frontend call
await groupContract.payForRecipient(groupId, recipientAddress, {
    value: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.1")
});
```

### Creating an Event
```javascript
// Frontend call
const eventId = await eventContract.createEvent(
    "Summer Beach Party",
    "Join us for an amazing beach party",
    "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D4C9db96C4b4d8b6",
    Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + (30 * 24 * 60 * 60) // 30 days from now
);
```

### Depositing to an Event
```javascript
// Frontend call
await eventContract.depositToEvent(eventId, ethers.utils.parseEther("0.05"), {
    value: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.05")
});
```

## Deployment

### Prerequisites:

- Hardhat
- OpenZeppelin Contracts

### Installation:
```bash
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
```

## Testing

Both contracts include comprehensive test coverage for:
- Contract creation and initialization
- Payment processing and validation
- Access control and permissions
- Edge cases and error conditions
- Event emissions
- Gas optimization

## Gas Optimization

The contracts are optimized for gas efficiency through:
- Efficient data structures
- Minimal storage operations
- Optimized loops and iterations
- Strategic use of mappings vs arrays
- Batch operations where possible

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- ERC-20 token support
- Multi-signature wallet integration
- Automated payment scheduling
- Advanced access control (roles)
- Integration with DeFi protocols
- Cross-chain functionality
